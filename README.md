Terraform Templates to Deploy Infrastructure onto Azure
PreRequisites:
Please see the section below pertaining to Credentials and Authentication
Code Organization:
    two-tier-sample/
    - az_two_tier.tf: Contains the definition of the various artifacts that will be deployed on Azure.
    - fw_vars.tf: Define the various variables that will be required as inputs to the Terraform template.
    - terraform.tfvars: Defines default values for all the variables.
Note: The fw_vars.tf has default values provided for certain variables. These can obviously be overridden by specifying those variables and values in the terraform.tfvars file.

Credentials and Authentication:
An Azure Service Principal, with the proper role and permissions needs to be created prior to deploying workloads into Azure using terraform.

    See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal-cli
Once the service principal has been created on Azure, create a file called "azure_provider.tf" (file name could be anything but should end with .tf) with the following fields (pertaining to the service principal):

  - provider "azurerm" {
        subscription_id = "<subscription_id>"
        client_id = "<client_id>"
        client_secret = "<secret used while creating the application>"
        tenant_id = "<tenant_id>"
    }
